			<p>
			I’ve been coding for over 2 years now and have learned some about 
			modern technologies and practices. Between my schoolwork and professional responsibilities, 
			writing code is a daily encounter.
			</p>
			<p>
			In school I’ve learned the basics of computer architecture, operating systems, and algorithmic 
			design. I’ve accomplished some projects to test my knowledge like building a mock CPU or 
			developing a memory manager that deallocates/allocates blocks of memory for a user. Through 
			these projects I have been able to hone my skills and become a better and more knowledgeable 
			programmer. I have also learned the importance of collaborating with others and maximizing time.
			</p>
			<p>
			As an intern at <a href = "https://www.lisam.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Lisam Systems<a> I work on a variety of problems that clients and managers have.  
			Most of the time I help provide modifications built to client specifications or help migrate 
			data into our software solutions for onboarding clients. From time to time I also develop tools 
			to retrieve regulatory information from different websites. To accomplish this, I use node.js 
			and a headless browser to create web scrappers that gather the information and store it in a 
			csv format or a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">Mongo<a> database. These tools drastically simplify tasks that would take multiple 
			people working weeks to accomplish. Each tool comes with its own set of challenges, but I am 
			always happy with what I produce and how much I learn.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am also passionate about teaching others what I know and inspiring them to pursue computer 
			science. My position as an RA at Texas A&M puts me in contact with a lot of underclassmen that 
			struggle with coding projects they must complete. I will often spend a few hours every week 
			walking them through coding assignments and answering questions. I know how hard it can be 
			starting out and want to make sure they receive the support they need to succeed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Overall, I love solving problems with computers and I hope I can have more opportunities in the 
			future to grow and accomplish greater things.
